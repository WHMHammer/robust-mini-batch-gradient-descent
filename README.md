# Robust Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

## Introduction

This repository contains the source codes and test results for the final project of COMP_SCI 496: Foundations of Reliability and Robustness in Machine Learning at Northwestern University.

Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD) is a simple yet effective machine learning model as a linear (and polynomial) regressor. However, the naive MBGD model with squared losses is very sensitive to outliers, making it vulnerable to adversary samples.

Our group is proposing to add a trimming procedure based on the losses when calculating the gradients to make the MBGD model more robust. We will measure the robustness of the modified model under the ε-contamination model by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) on the testing sets (without noise nor contamination).

We will test with different patterns of contamination. See the test results section for details.

## Algorithm

    Procedure kernel_preprocessing:
        For all samples:
            calculate the lowest and highest indices of the kernels that include the sample
        For all kernels:
            combine the samples within the kernel, if and only if the number of samples is larger than the threshold
        Return the combined samples only

    Procedure fit:
        Initialize w
        While not converged and not exceeding max_iter iterations:
            Randomly select batch_size samples without replacement
            Calculate the losses of all the samples in the batch
            Calculate the gradient of the losses with respect to w, ignoring the effects of the ε ⋅ batch_size samples with the largest losses
            Update w

## Run Tests

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m tests
```

## Procedures to Add More Test(s)

1. Create a new file under `tests/`

2. Define a/some function(s) performing the new test(s) in the newly created file

3. Import the newly created file in `tests/__main__.py`

4. Call the newly defined function(s) in `tests/__main__.py`
